MY EXPERIENCE AND CHALLENGES FACED:

SECTION 1: HTML
-In this section i learnt about the basic syntax of html and was able to build the HTML structure of the Token Minter dApp. It was an exciting experience as delivering the project was easy due to the simplicity and detailed explanation from the course lessons. I faced no major challenges completing this section.

SECTION 2: CSS
-In this section i learnt about CSS, its syntax as well as importance for styling web pages. I learnt about CSS3 and how it has introduced essential features for styling modern web applications. I was able to complete the styling of the dAPP with AI assistance as well as overriding some of the default values from the bootstrap Framework I was also able to customize the dApp to my taste by overriding some of the bootstrap CSS in my custom.css stylesheet.

- I faced only one challenge. I was trying to customize a hover effect for the links on the navigation bar by overriding the bootstrap css. My changes were not being effected on the webpage. However i realized that it was a problem of specificity of the styling as bootstrap style was taking higher preference. i solved this by using the !important keyword in the selector.
